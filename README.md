## The Rules
*For a space that is 'populated':*

- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.

- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

*For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'*

- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
