## The Rules
*For a space that is 'alive':*

- Each cell with less than 2 neighbors dies, as if by solitude.

- Each cell with 4 or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

- Each cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.

*For a space that is 'dead'*

- Each cell with 3 neighbors becomes populated.
